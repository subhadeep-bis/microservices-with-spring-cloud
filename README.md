# microservices-with-spring-cloud
## Learning Important topics of Spring Cloud

1.  SPRING CLOUD CONFIG SERVER AND BUS
2.  LOAD BALANCING WITH RIBBON AND FEIGN
3.  IMPLEMENT NAMING SERVER WITH EUREKA
4.  IMPLEMENTING API GATEWAY WITH ZUUL
5.  DISTRIBUTED TRACING WITH ZIPKIN

## What are Microservices?
A service can be defined as a microservice if it has the following three things
* __The service is Exposed by REST__
* __Small well chosen Deployable Units__
* __Cloud Enabled__

## Challenges with building Microservices
| Challenges                        |   Solution                                                     |
| --------------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------:|
| 1.  BOUNDED CONTEXT               | Evolutionary. This is something that comes with __EXPERIENCE__ |
| 2.  CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT      | __Spring Cloud Config Server__                                 |
| 3.  DYNAMIC SCALE UP/DOWN         | __Eureka, Ribbon Load Balancing, Feign__                       |
| 4.  VISIBILITY                    | __Zipkin Distributed Tracing, Netflix API Gateway__            |  
| 5.  FAULT TOLERENCE               | __Hystrix__                                                    |
